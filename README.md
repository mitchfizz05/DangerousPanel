# DangerousPanel
Elite Dangerous control panel for tablets (phones may be coming soon).

Allows you to do various actions from a web interface which can be opened on any tablet.

Runs over websockets, therefore there is very minimal (hardly noticable) delay. Runs very smooth, and looks quite good in my opinion.

Only compatible with Windows. No intentions to port at this point since this program uses the Windows API to send keystrokes (highler level alternatives didn't work).
